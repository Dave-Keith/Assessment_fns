# Survey overview

This report provides an overview of survey results. At each survey station, the 8 ft scallop dredge is towed for 10 minutes, and scallop are counted and assigned to 5mm size bins (ranging from 0-200mm). This information informs the abundance time series, shell height frequency, clapper time series, and spatial distribution figures. 

Detailed sampling occurs at a selection of the stations, where the exact heights and weights are recorded for a subsample of the scallops caught. This allows for the calculation of biomass and condition that are presented in the biomass time series, meat weight-shell height relationship, and condition time series figures. 

The spring survey occurred from 2021-06-05 to 2021-06-26 on Middle Bank, Sable Bank, German Bank, and Browns Bank North, Browns Bank South, and the Georges Bank monitoring stations. The Chief Scientist was Tricia Pearo Drew, and the survey was carried out on the Fundy Leader.

## Survey Design

The survey of Middle Bank in 2021 used a fixed survey design. There were 15 fixed stations.

In the Middle Bank survey, pre-recruits are considered to be scallops with shell heights less than 80 mm, recruits have shell heights from 80 mm to 90 mm, and fully-recruited scallop have shell heights greater than 90 mm. Recruits are expected to grow to commercial size in the next year.

## Abundance & biomass time series summary



Abundance and biomass throughout the survey time series are presented using numbers or kilograms of scallop per standardized tow, respectively (Figures 2 & 3). Estimates are standardized to tows of 800 metres. Note that error bars are not calculated for fixed station survey designs as they do not properly account for uncertainty.  Tables 1 & 2 provide the plotted values for the current and previous surveys, and long term medians, by size class.

## Meat weight-shell height & condition

On Middle Bank in 2021, the empirical meat weight-shell height relationship (Figure 5) estimated that a scallop with a a shell height of 100mm would have a meat weight of approximately 17 grams. The modelled (GAMM) condition factor estimate increased from 16.03 in the previous survey, to 17.01 in 2021, and was greater than the long term median of 13.69.

## Clapper time series

Patterns in natural mortality are represented by the percentage of clappers (dead scallop, with empty hinged shells) caught in the survey tows. The percentage is calculated as the number of clappers in each size class relative to the total of dead and live scallop caught in that size class (Figure 11). Survey tows are standardized to 800 metres. Note that error bars are not calculated for fixed station survey designs as they do not properly account for uncertainty.  Table 5 provides the plotted values for the current and previous surveys, and long term medians, by size class.

## Biomass, meat count, and shell height relationship

Figure 12 provides an overview the relationship between biomass, meat count, and shell height, by showing the biomass for each shell height bin and the meat count for each shell height bin. Scallop with shell heights of 86.82 mm and above at the time of the survey would result in meat counts at or below the regulation (45 mm).

The blue vertical lines represent the recruit size range. The dashed red lines delineate the size range at wich you would have a meat count of 45 mm or below.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-20}

## Survey Design

The survey of Sable Bank in 2021 used a stratified random survey design. There were 100 stratified random stations.

In the Sable Bank survey, pre-recruits are considered to be scallops with shell heights less than 80 mm, recruits have shell heights from 80 mm to 90 mm, and fully-recruited scallop have shell heights greater than 90 mm. Recruits are expected to grow to commercial size in the next year.

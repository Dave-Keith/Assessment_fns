# Survey overview

The spring offshore scallop survey occurred from 2021-06-05 to 2021-06-26 on Middle Bank, Sable Bank, German Bank, and Browns Bank North, Browns Bank South, and the Georges Bank monitoring stations. The Chief Scientist was Tricia Pearo Drew, and the survey was carried out on the Fundy Leader.

This report summarizes the information collected during the survey. At each survey station, the 8-ft scallop dredge is towed for 10 minutes, and scallop are counted and assigned to 5mm size bins (ranging from 0-200mm). This information informs the abundance time series, shell height frequency, clapper time series, and spatial distribution figures. 

Detailed sampling occurred at a selection of the stations, where the exact heights and weights are recorded for a subsample of the scallops caught. This allows for the calculation of biomass and condition that are presented in the biomass time series, meat weight-shell height relationship, and condition time series figures. 

Some of the figures and analyses presented in this report refer to the different size classes of scallop: pre-recruits, recruits, and fully-recruited scallop. The size ranges for each size class differs by bank, but the general convention is that recruits are expected to grow to commercial size in the next year, while fully-recruited scallops were commercial size at the time of the survey. 

We also compare values from the current survey to the most recent previous survey, and/or to long term medians. In this report, all long term medians exclude the value from the current year.

## Survey Design & Analysis {#MidSD}

The survey of Middle Bank in 2021 used a fixed survey design. There were 15 fixed stations.

In the Middle Bank survey, pre-recruits are considered to be scallops with shell heights less than 80 mm, recruits have shell heights from 80 mm to 90 mm, and fully-recruited scallop have shell heights greater than 90 mm.

\newpage


## Abundance & biomass time series summary {#MidABTS}



Abundance and biomass throughout the survey time series are presented using numbers or kilograms of scallop per standardized tow, respectively (Figures 2 & 3). Estimates are standardized to tows of 800 metres. Note that error bars are not calculated for fixed station survey designs as they do not properly account for uncertainty.  Tables 1 & 2 provide the plotted values for the current and previous surveys, and long term medians, by size class.

## Meat weight-shell height & condition {#MidMWSH}

On Middle Bank in 2021, the empirical meat weight-shell height relationship (Figure 5) estimated that a scallop with a a shell height of 100mm would have a meat weight of approximately 17 grams. The modelled (GAMM) condition factor estimate increased from 16.0 in the previous survey, to 17.0 in 2021, and was greater than the long term median of 13.7.

## Clapper time series {#Midclap}

Patterns in natural mortality are represented by the percentage of clappers (dead scallop, with empty hinged shells) caught in the survey tows.

Survey tows are standardized to 800 metres. Note that error bars are not calculated for fixed station survey designs as they do not properly account for uncertainty.  Table 5 provides the plotted values for the current and previous surveys, and long term medians, by size class.

Figure 12 provides an overview the relationship between biomass, meat count, and shell height, by showing the biomass for each shell height bin and the meat count for each shell height bin. Scallop with shell heights of 86.8 mm and above at the time of the survey would result in meat counts at or below the regulation (45 mm).

## Survey Design & Analysis {#SabSD}

The survey of Sable Bank in 2021 used a stratified random survey design. There were 100 stratified random stations.

In the Sable Bank survey, pre-recruits are considered to be scallops with shell heights less than 80 mm, recruits have shell heights from 80 mm to 90 mm, and fully-recruited scallop have shell heights greater than 90 mm.

## Survey Design & Analysis {#GerSD}

The survey of German Bank in 2021 used a sampling with partial replacement survey design. There were 60 random stations within the survey domain, and 20 stations repeated from the previous survey, and 3 exploratory stations.

In the German Bank survey, pre-recruits are considered to be scallops with shell heights less than 95 mm, recruits have shell heights from 95 mm to 105 mm, and fully-recruited scallop have shell heights greater than 105 mm.

On German Bank in 2021, the empirical meat weight-shell height relationship (Figure 15) estimated that a scallop with a a shell height of 100mm would have a meat weight of approximately 9.9 grams. The modelled (GAMM) condition factor estimate decreased from 12.0 in the previous survey, to 10.6 in 2021, and was less than the long term median of 11.4.

## Survey Design & Analysis {#BBsSD}

The survey of Browns Bank South in 2021 used a stratified random survey design. There were 25 stratified random stations.

In the Browns Bank South survey, pre-recruits are considered to be scallops with shell heights less than 85 mm, recruits have shell heights from 85 mm to 95 mm, and fully-recruited scallop have shell heights greater than 95 mm.

## Survey Design & Analysis {#BBnSD}

The survey of Browns Bank North in 2021 used a stratified random survey design. There were 100 stratified random stations.

In the Browns Bank North survey, pre-recruits are considered to be scallops with shell heights less than 85 mm, recruits have shell heights from 85 mm to 95 mm, and fully-recruited scallop have shell heights greater than 95 mm.

## Abundance & biomass time series summary {#BBnABTS}



Abundance and biomass throughout the survey time series are presented using numbers or kilograms of scallop per standardized tow, respectively (Figures 10 & 15). Estimates are standardized to tows of 800 metres.  Tables 21 & 22 provide the plotted values for the current and previous surveys, and long term medians, by size class.

## Meat weight-shell height & condition {#BBnMWSH}

On Browns Bank North in 2021, the empirical meat weight-shell height relationship (Figure 25) estimated that a scallop with a a shell height of 100mm would have a meat weight of approximately 12 grams. The modelled (GAMM) condition factor estimate decreased from 15.0 in the previous survey, to 11.7 in 2021, and was less than the long term median of 12.5.

## Survey Design & Analysis {#GBSD}

The survey of Georges Bank (monitoring stations) in 2021 used a fixed survey design. There were 24 fixed stations.

In the Georges Bank (monitoring stations) survey, pre-recruits are considered to be scallops with shell heights less than 85 mm, recruits have shell heights from 85 mm to 95 mm, and fully-recruited scallop have shell heights greater than 95 mm.

## Abundance & biomass time series summary {#GBABTS}



Abundance and biomass throughout the survey time series are presented using numbers or kilograms of scallop per standardized tow, respectively (Figures 12 & 18). Estimates are standardized to tows of 800 metres. Note that error bars are not calculated for fixed station survey designs as they do not properly account for uncertainty.  Tables 26 & 27 provide the plotted values for the current and previous surveys, and long term medians, by size class.

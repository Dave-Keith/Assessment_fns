# Survey overview

The Summer Offshore Scallop Survey occurred from August 6 to `r stamp("March 1, 2021")(max(dates$end) + days(1))` on Georges Bank 'a' and 'b'. The Chief Scientist was Tricia Pearo Drew, and the survey was carried out on the Fundy Leader.

This report summarizes the information collected during the survey. At each survey station, the 8-ft scallop dredge is towed for 10 minutes, and all sea scallops are counted and assigned to 5mm shell height bins (ranging from 0-200mm). This information informs the abundance time series, shell height frequency, clapper time series, and spatial distribution figures. 

Detailed sampling occurred at a selection of the stations, where the exact shell heights and meat weights are recorded for a subsample of the scallops caught. This allows for the calculation of biomass and condition that are presented in the biomass time series, meat weight-shell height relationship, and condition time series figures. *In 2021, the 10 samples collected in tow 301 on Georges Bank 'b' were excluded from the meat weight-shell height relationship and condition factor calculation for the bank. The meat weight-shell height relationship for this tow was highly unusual compared to past and current sampled tows, and had a disproportionate impact on the bank-wide relationship this year. To ensure that the meat weight-shell height relationship is representative of the population on Georges 'b' this year, the sampling data for this tow have been excluded from the results found in this report and will be excluded from all future analyses. Results informing this decision were presented and discussed at the Survey Summary Meeting, held November 1, 2021.* 

Some of the figures and analyses presented in this report refer to the different size classes of scallop: pre-recruits, recruits, and fully-recruited scallops. The shell height ranges for each size class differs by bank, but the general convention is that recruits are expected to grow to commercial size in the next year, while fully-recruited scallops were commercial size at the time of the survey. 

We also compare values from the current survey to the most recent previous survey, and/or to long term medians. In this report, all long term medians exclude the value from the current year. For this 2021 survey, results are compared to the 2019 survey results since the full assessment survey did not occur in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

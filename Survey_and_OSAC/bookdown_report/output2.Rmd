# Survey overview

The Summer Offshore Scallop Survey occurred from August 02 to August 15, 2022 on Georges Bank 'a' and 'b'. The Chief Scientist was Tricia Pearo Drew, and the survey was carried out on the Fundy Leader.

This report summarizes the information collected during the survey. At each survey station, the 8-ft scallop dredge is towed for 10 minutes, and all sea scallops are counted and assigned to 5mm shell height bins (ranging from 0-200mm). This information informs the abundance time series, shell height frequency, clapper time series, and spatial distribution figures. 

Detailed sampling occurred at a selection of the stations, where the exact shell heights and meat weights are recorded for a subsample of the scallops caught. This allows for the calculation of biomass and condition that are presented in the biomass time series, meat weight-shell height relationship, and condition time series figures. 

Some of the figures and analyses presented in this report refer to the different size classes of scallop: pre-recruits, recruits, and fully-recruited scallops. The shell height range for each size class differs by bank, but the general convention is that recruits are expected to grow to commercial size in the next year, while fully-recruited scallops were commercial size at the time of the survey. 

We also compare values from the current survey to the most recent previous survey, and/or to long term medians. In this report, all long term medians exclude the value from the current year. 


## Special considerations  

During the 2022 survey, both Olex and Ocean Vision navigational software programs were used. All tows were tracked using both programs, but tracks from Ocean Vision were used to calculate the distance coefficients needed to standardize tow lengths. 

In 2022, before the Spring Survey occurred, all historical survey data were loaded to the DFO SCALOFF database following the completion of a comprehensive data review. For the majority of banks and years, this review had no impact on survey summary results. The following corrections had minor impacts on survey summary results for the figures noted: 

-  Georges Bank 'a': 1 tow of sampling data from 1987 was excluded due to data validation issues, depths were corrected for 11 sampled tows in 1998 (Figure 5)
-  Georges Bank 'b': 4 tows of sampling data from 1987 were excluded due to data validation issues, 1 tow was re-assigned to stratum 101 in 1992 (previously, stratum 102), depths were corrected for 3 sampled tows in 1998 (Figures 14, 15, 17, and 23)

## Survey Design & Analysis {#GBaSD}

The survey of Georges Bank 'a' in 2022 used a stratified random survey design (Figure 1). There were 200 stratified random stations, and 8 exploratory stations.

In the Georges Bank 'a' survey, pre-recruits are considered to be scallops with shell heights less than 85 mm, recruits have shell heights from 85 mm to 94 mm, and fully-recruited scallop have shell heights greater than or equal to 95 mm.

## Abundance & biomass time series summary {#GBaABTS}



Abundance and biomass throughout the survey time series are presented using numbers and kilograms of scallop per standardized tow, respectively (Figures 2 & 3). Estimates are standardized to tows of 800 metres.  Tables 1 & 2 provide the values for the current and previous surveys, and long term medians, by size class.

## Meat weight-shell height & condition {#GBaMWSH}

On Georges Bank 'a' in 2022, the empirical meat weight-shell height relationship (Figure 5) estimated that a scallop with a shell height of 100mm would have a meat weight of approximately 17 grams. The modelled (GAMM) condition factor estimate decreased from 18.4 in the previous survey (2021), to 17.1 in 2022, and was above the long term median of 15.2.

## Clapper time series {#GBaclap}

Patterns in natural mortality are represented by the percentage of clappers (dead scallop, with empty hinged shells) caught in the survey tows. The percentage is calculated as the number of clappers in each size class relative to the total of dead and live scallop caught in that size class (Figure 11). Survey tows are standardized to 800 metres.  Table 5 provides the values for the current and previous surveys, and long term medians, by size class.

## Biomass, meat count, and shell height relationship {#GBabreakdown}

Figure 12 provides an overview of the relationship between biomass, meat count, and shell height, by showing the biomass for each shell height bin and the meat count for each shell height bin. Scallop with shell heights of 96.9 mm and above at the time of the survey would result in meat counts at or below the regulation (33).

The solid red line is the estimated meat count for each shell height bin. Biomass (kilograms per standardized tow, kg/tow) is on the y-axis in the bottom panel. The dashed red lines delineate the size range at which you would have a meat count of 33 or below. The blue vertical lines represent the recruit size range.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-20}

## Clapper time series {#GBbclap}

Patterns in natural mortality are represented by the percentage of clappers (dead scallop, with empty hinged shells) caught in the survey tows. The percentage is calculated as the number of clappers in each size class relative to the total of dead and live scallop caught in that size class (Figure 23). Survey tows are standardized to 800 metres.  Table 10 provides the values for the current and previous surveys, and long term medians, by size class.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-18}Percentage of clappers per standardized tow by size class, for the current survey, previous survey, and long term median.}

\begin{tabular}[t]{llll}
\toprule
Size class & 2021 survey & 2022 survey & Long term median\\
\midrule
Pre-recruits (<85mm) & 5.35 & 1.04 & 4.47\\
Recruits (85-94mm) & 7.22 & 6.95 & 6.02\\
Fully-recruited ($\geq$95mm) & 6.52 & 4.20 & 5.72\\

## Biomass, meat count, and shell height relationship {#GBbbreakdown}

Figure 24 provides an overview of the relationship between biomass, meat count, and shell height, by showing the biomass for each shell height bin and the meat count for each shell height bin. Scallop with shell heights of 96.4 mm and above at the time of the survey would result in meat counts at or below the regulation (50).

\caption{The relationship between biomass and meat count for Georges Bank 'b' in 2022. Shell height (5 mm bins) is on the x-axis. Meat count is on the y-axis in the top panel. The solid red line is the estimated meat count for each shell height bin. Biomass (kilograms per standardized tow, kg/tow) is on the y-axis in the bottom panel. The dashed red lines delineate the size range at which you would have a meat count of 50 or below. The blue vertical lines represent the recruit size range.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-20}

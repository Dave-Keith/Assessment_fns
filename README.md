Some tips/best practices: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

New users should be added as collaborators and FORK the master to your personal github account and then link this to your hard-drive. Be sure to mimic the file structure of our network drive to ensure the scripts work. All independent work is to be performed on a personal FORK that lives on your PC or hard drive (we suggest using a branch on your personal fork).

Within your fork you can take care of your own pull requests.  A Pull request from your fork to the Mar-scal master should be submitted when a collaborator wishes to merge their work with the master. Issues can be opened and closed as needed, and integrated with pull requests too. 

Collaborators *can* merge their pull requests independently, but complicated edits *should* be discussed before being merged with the master on Mar-scal as these are now immediately implemented on our shared network.

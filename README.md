Some tips/best practices: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

New users should be added as collaborators and clone the master branch to your hard-drive. Be sure to mimic the file structure. All independent work is to be performed on a personal branch that lives on your PC or hard drive. 

Pull requests are submitted when a collaborator wishes to merge their work with the master branch. Issues can be opened and closed as needed, and integrated with pull requests too. 

Collaborators *can* merge their pull requests indepdently, but complicated edits *should* be discussed before being merged with the master branch. After major edits are performed, the master branch should be moved to the official (non-Githubbed) production folder.
